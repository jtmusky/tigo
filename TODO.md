# Planning and TODO

## Requirements
[ ] Double check that directory is a git repo
[ ] Goback to previous git repo "Last Repo used" 
[ ] Display oneflow guide
[ ] Ask user to use default tigrc
[ ] Display the what branch the the repo is currently in
[ ] Save .tigorc dir for consistancy

## Nice to have
[ ] Check for upgrades
[ ] Use vim keys? 
[ ] Indicate/notify if there are any dirty files in the repo choice list
[ ] Fall back? Could probably use "select" construct
